Welcome to your new Astro blog. This post exists to demonstrate the markdown
styling that ships with the theme (port of the GitHub-flavored `blog.css`).

## Headings

The theme styles `h1` through `h6`, blockquotes, tables, lists, inline code and
code blocks.

## Tables

| Column | Meaning | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `title` | Post title | string |
| `date` | Publish date | date |
| `tags` | Optional tags | string[] |

## Code

```js
const greeting = 'hello world';
console.log(greeting);
```

## Lists

1. Write markdown files under `src/content/blog/`.
2. Add frontmatter (`title`, `date`, optional `description`, `tags`).
3. Run `npm run dev`.

- The file name becomes the URL slug.
- Drafts (`draft: true`) are hidden from the build.

Enjoy!
